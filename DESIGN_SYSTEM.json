Include 1-2 3D-style icons or emojis relevant to theme. Keep generous margins (100px+). Use asymmetric balance - heavy headline one side, playful elements balancing the other. Maximum 3 accent colors. White text only, never light-on-light. This should feel like optimistic startup culture meets professional HR - energetic but trustworthy, playful but purposeful. Think 'HR that makes people actually want to engage.'"
